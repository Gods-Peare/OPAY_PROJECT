💰 OPay Interface with Flutter

Built with Flutter & Dart | Cross-Platform UI

This project is a UI recreation inspired by the OPay mobile application, developed using Flutter.
Rather than copying functionality, the focus is on visual layout, screen transitions, and adaptive UI behavior across various devices.

It serves as a hands-on practice project for building structured, scalable Flutter interfaces that resemble real-world fintech apps.

	⁠🚫 Notice
This repository has no connection to OPay or its services.
It exists solely for educational use and personal portfolio presentation.
